# PBO Jeugdcup ranking

## Problem statement
After every PBO jeugdcup tournament, a responsible person at PBO needs to update the PBO Jeugdcupranking based on the 
tournament results. Meaning for every player, the best cross-discipline result needs to be calculated.  As this is 
rather time consuming (and needs to be done shortly after the tournament itself, so no flexibility there), a software 
utility can help with this process.

## Software solution
A Java8 app that runs in AzureCloud using AzureFunctions that is processing a single TP file 
and returns the PBO Jeugdcup points earned for every player in the tournament.

## Quick start
 * Use the [upload page](https://badminton-pbo.github.io/pbo-jeugdcupranking/upload) available on github pages to upload an process a TP file
 * Include the returnd CSV into the PBO Juegdcupranking excel file
